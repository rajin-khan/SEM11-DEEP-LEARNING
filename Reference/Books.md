# ðŸ“˜ Deep Learning Course â€“ Required Books

This file lists the two essential books for the deep learning course, their roles, and how we will use them during the semester.

---

## **Book 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
**Link:** [http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)

- **Primary book for the course**
- Must be **read thoroughly and almost memorized**
- Written in an intuitive, beginner-friendly way
- Focuses on foundational concepts like:
  - Backpropagation
  - Gradient descent
  - Neural network architectures
  - Practical insights into learning and regularization
- We will **follow this book actively throughout the entire semester.**

## **Book 2: Deep Learning (Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville)**
**Link:** [https://www.deeplearningbook.org/](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

- **Mathematically rigorous reference book**
- Weâ€™ll start reading it from **mid-semester onward**
- Use it primarily for:
  - Deeper theoretical understanding
  - Formal math and proofs
  - Referencing during **project work and academic paper writing**
- Sections like optimization algorithms, probabilistic models, and deep generative models will be especially relevant.
